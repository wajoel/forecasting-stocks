## Introduction
Stock price forecasting is a challenging task due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of financial markets. This project explores various machine learning and statistical models to predict stock prices using historical data. The repository includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation pipelines.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock data from APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, feature engineering).
- **Modeling**: Implement machine learning and deep learning models for time series forecasting.
- **Visualization**: Visualize stock trends, predictions, and model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wajoel/forecasting-stocks.git
cd forecasting-stocks

# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Run the data collection script to fetch historical stock data:
     ```bash
     python scripts/fetch_data.py --ticker AAPL --start 2020-01-01 --end 2023-01-01
     ```

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Preprocess the data for model training:
     ```bash
     python scripts/preprocess_data.py --input data/raw/AAPL.csv --output data/processed/AAPL_processed.csv
     ```

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a model using the preprocessed data:
     ```bash
     python scripts/train_model.py --data data/processed/AAPL_processed.csv --model lstm
     ```

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance:
     ```bash
     python scripts/evaluate_model.py --model models/lstm_model.h5 --data data/processed/AAPL_processed.csv
     ```

5. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results:
     ```bash
     python scripts/visualize_results.py --predictions results/predictions.csv
     ```

## Models
The following models are implemented in this repository:
- **LSTM**: Long Short-Term Memory networks for time series forecasting.
- **ARIMA**: A statistical model for time series analysis.
- **Random Forest**: A machine learning model for regression tasks.
- **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook for time series data.

## Results
The analysis includes the following key components:

### Summary Statistics
- **Mean**: The average value of the stock prices over the selected period.
- **Variance**: Measures the spread of the stock prices.
- **Skewness**: Indicates the asymmetry of the distribution of stock prices.
- **Kurtosis**: Measures the "tailedness" of the distribution.

### Stationarity Test
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**: Used to determine whether the time series is stationary. A p-value below a threshold (e.g., 0.05) indicates stationarity.

### Autocorrelation & Partial Autocorrelation
- **ACF (Autocorrelation Function) Plot**: Helps identify the correlation of the time series with its lagged values.
- **PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function) Plot**: Helps identify the direct correlation between the time series and its lagged values, excluding intermediate lags.

### Volatility Analysis
- **Rolling Mean**: A moving average of stock prices to smooth out short-term fluctuations.
- **Rolling Standard Deviation**: Measures the volatility of stock prices over a rolling window.

### Trend & Seasonality Decomposition
- **STL Decomposition**: Breaks down the time series into three components:
  - **Trend**: The long-term movement in the data.
  - **Seasonality**: Periodic fluctuations.
  - **Residual**: The remaining noise after removing trend and seasonality.

Sample visualizations and results can be found in the `results/` directory.
